function to determine if a unit is a strict function
better connection paths
more meta units
  key input - have actual window for it?
  char out - have actual window for it?
  graphics - have actual window for it?
  sound? (maybe eventually)
  signed int out
  timeclock (how big enough?)
  scripting - have actual window for it.
    individual, or shared environment?  I guess individual
prod terminal
MOD unit?
function to reduce units to logic - kinda cheating, but would super help optimization
recursive replace (by name)
  recursive update, from main?
scale place spinner
function to collect basic stats; unit count, connection count
save notes with unit?
make transfer able to shift labels
auto-gen series of labels

Eventually look into matrix electronics



Note:
all units should be idempotent
units whose output are not a function of the current inputs, you should be careful about when the signal gets to them
  if they ARE a function, it doesn't matter.  I think.
signed div is wonky with negative nums, prolly bc of GTE
the ALU's flag bit is wonky for most everything, 'cept on div => div by 0
